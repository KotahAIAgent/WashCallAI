## ❌ Features NOT in Mobile App (Web Only)

### Configuration & Setup (Better on Desktop)
- ❌ **Inbound AI Configuration** - Agent setup and phone number management
- ❌ **Outbound AI Configuration** - Outbound settings and scheduling
- ❌ **Campaign Management** - Create and manage calling campaigns

- ❌ **Workflows** - Automation workflow configuration
- ❌ **Integrations** - Third-party integrations setup

- ❌ **Pricing** - Subscription management

## Why Some Features Are Web-Only

### 1. **Configuration Pages**
- **Reason**: Complex forms and settings are better suited for desktop
- **Mobile Alternative**: Clients can use web app for configuration, mobile for monitoring

### 2. **Analytics**
- **Reason**: Charts and detailed analytics require larger screens
- **Mobile Alternative**: Simplified dashboard with key metrics

### 3. **Billing & Settings**
- **Reason**: Sensitive operations and complex forms
- **Mobile Alternative**: Use web app for account management

## Mobile App Focus

The mobile app is designed for **monitoring and viewing**, not configuration:

- 📱 **View live calls** as they happen
- 🔔 **Get instant notifications** when calls arrive
- 📊 **Check statistics** on the go
- 👥 **View leads** and call history
- 📝 **Read transcripts** and summaries

## Recommendation

**Use both apps together:**
- **Web App**: For setup, configuration, detailed analytics, and management
- **Mobile App**: For monitoring, notifications, and quick access to call information

This separation provides:
- ✅ Better UX (right tool for the right task)
- ✅ Faster mobile app (focused on essential features)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (simpler codebase)

## Future Enhancements

If you want to add more features to mobile:

1. **Settings (Basic)** - View-only settings, link to web for changes
2. **Analytics (Simplified)** - Key charts optimized for mobile
3. **Quick Actions** - Common actions like updating lead status
4. **Offline Support** - Cache data for offline viewing

Would you like me to add any of these features?
